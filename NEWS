libkdtree++ NEWS
================

02 Dec 2007:
   It's Christmas, and libkdtree++ packs in more power for the find
   and find_nearest functions. Performance improvement should be
   carried on with other part of the interface in the coming months.

   As a result of these modification, KDTree definition has been a
   little altered. The new definition includes a template for a
   distance calculator. This functor by default calcultes the square
   of th difference between two elements returned by the accessor.

   Sylvain Bougerel spent some time cleaning up the code and build
   infrastructure of the code from Sourceforge, and I imported the
   results of his work to a git repository on git.debian.org today.
