libkdtree++ TODO list
=====================

- DOCUMENTATION
- consistent use of throw () in function decl/defn.
- keep tree balanced in insert() and erase().
- erase(range)
- improved copy constructor and operator= (Paul Harris)
- possibly rename all __* variables, since __* is reserved for the compiler.
    --> get rid of the crackhead STL-style naming
- support mutable items
- add policies/traits
